📊 Task 7: Sales Summary using SQLite and Python
This project is part of the Elevate Data Analyst Internship program. The task was to extract and summarize sales data using SQL queries in Python and visualize the results using a bar chart.

📌 Objective
Connect Python to a SQLite database
Run SQL queries to get:
Total quantity sold per product
Total revenue per product (quantity * price)
Load results into pandas
Display results using print()
Visualize with a bar chart using matplotlib
🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
Python
SQLite (sqlite3)
pandas
matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)
📁 Project Files
Task_7_sales_summary.ipynb – main notebook with all code and output
README.md – this file
💡 Summary Output
The SQL query produced a summary table like:

product	total_qty	revenue
Product A	17	1700
Product B	7	1400
Product C	14	2100
📊 Visualization
A bar chart was plotted using matplotlib to show revenue by product.
